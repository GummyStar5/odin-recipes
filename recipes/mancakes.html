    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm maple syrup, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. 
            Off heat, stir green onions into bacon; sauté in hot drippings until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer; drain. Reserve drippings.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl; whisk in drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon reserved drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop ¼ cupfuls of batter per mancake onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip; cook until browned on other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Transfer mancakes to a plate; top with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
