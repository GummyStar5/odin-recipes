        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 thick slices day-old French bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>8 thin slices cooked ham</li>
            <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices Havarti cheese</li>
            <li>8 poached eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk 2 eggs, cream, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, 1 pinch salt, and 1 pinch cayenne pepper together in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Lay bread slices, one at a time, into egg mixture; let bread absorb mixture. Flip bread slices; let bread absorb mixture until almost all mixture has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add butter and let melt. Add bread slices; cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer French toast to a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Add ham slices to the skillet; cook until begins to brown, about 1 minute per side.</li>
            <li>Place 1 slice Cheddar cheese on 1 slice French toast, top with 2 slices ham, and top ham with 1 slice Havarti cheese. Repeat with remaining Cheddar cheese, French toast, ham, and Havarti cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until French toast slices are no longer wet, batter is set, and cheeses have melted and begun to brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches on serving plates; top each with 2 poached eggs and chives. Season with 1 pinch salt and 1 pinch cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
